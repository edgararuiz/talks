## Use case

Using loan data, we want to use a model that estimates an appropriate interest 
rate, and then use that model to find out if the interest rate for a given loan
may have been too high. The loan data is in a table located in the Databricks 
Unity Catalog. The ultimate objective of the project, is to have it check on 
a daily basis to see what loans may an issue. 

## Approach

*"Fit small, predict big"*

To make it as close to a 'real-life' scenario, we will download a sample of the 
table into our Python session, fit a model using a Scikit Learn pipeline, and
then use Orbital to translate the steps and estimates into a SQL statement. 
Finally, we will use that SQL statement as the base to compare the current 
interest against the prediction, and download the loans that had a large 
difference. Thanks to the integrated environment in Databricks, the resulting
SQL statement will be saved in the Databricks Workspace, and used to run
on a schedule via a [Databricks Job](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/jobs/).

## Download sample

1.  The [`odbc::databricks()`](https://odbc.r-dbi.org/reference/databricks.html) 
function provides lots of convenient features that handle essentially everything
needed to establish a connection to Databricks. The only thing to provide is 
the `httpPath` in order to succeed. The connection is established via `DBI`.

    ```{r}
    library(DBI)
    
    con <- dbConnect(
      drv = odbc::databricks(), 
      httpPath = "/sql/1.0/warehouses/b71952ebceb705ce"
      )
    ```

2.  Because they will be used in multiple locations in this example, the `catalog`,
`schema`, and `table` name are loaded to variables

    ```{r}
    catalog <- "sol_eng_demo_nickp"
    schema <- "end-to-end"
    table <- "loans_full_schema"
    ```

3.  Sample the database table using the `TABLESAMPLE` SQL function. `REPEATABLE` 
is used to aid with reproducibility.  The `glue_sql()` function is used to 
compile the SQL statement.

    ```{r}
    library(glue)
    
    sample_sql <- glue_sql(
      "SELECT * ", 
      "FROM ",
      "{`catalog`}.{`schema`}.{`table`}",
      "TABLESAMPLE (100 ROWS) REPEATABLE (999)",
      .con = con
      )
    
    sample_sql
    ```

4.  The sample is downloaded by executing the SQL statement via `dbGetQuery()`.
    
    ```{r}
    sample_lending <- dbGetQuery(
      conn = con, 
      statement = sample_sql
      )
    ```



## Fit locally

```{r}
set.seed(999)
library(tidymodels)

sample_lending <- sample_lending |> 
  mutate(
    total_credit_lines = as.double(total_credit_lines),
    loan_amount = as.double(loan_amount),
    term = as.double(term)
    )

split_lending <- initial_split(sample_lending)

lending_training <- training(split_lending)

train_lend <- lending_training[, c("annual_income", "total_credit_lines", "loan_amount",  "term", "interest_rate")]
rec_lending <- recipe(
  interest_rate ~ annual_income + total_credit_lines + loan_amount + term, 
  data = lending_training
  ) |> 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())


lm_spec <- linear_reg()

wf_spec <- workflow(rec_lending, lm_spec)

wf_fit <- fit(wf_spec, lending_training)

wf_fit
```




## Convert to SQL using Orbital

```{r}
library(orbital)

lending_orbital <-  orbital(wf_fit, prefix = "pred")

lending_orbital
```
## Build report 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)

tbl_lending <- tbl(con, I(glue("{catalog}.`{schema}`.{table}")))

tbl_lending
```



```{r}
tbl_prep <- tbl_lending |> 
  mutate(o_annual_income = annual_income, 
         o_total_credit_lines = total_credit_lines,
         o_loan_amount = loan_amount, 
         o_term = term
         ) |> 
  mutate(!!! orbital_inline(lending_orbital)) |> 
  select(
    pred, interest_rate, emp_title, balance, application_type,
    o_annual_income, o_total_credit_lines, o_loan_amount, o_term
  ) 

tbl_prep |> 
  head()
```

```{r}
tbl_final <- tbl_prep |> 
  filter(interest_rate - pred > 15)
```

```{r}
tbl_final
```


```{r}
tbl_final |> 
  show_query()
```

```{r}
final_sql <- remote_query(tbl_final)

final_sql
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, final_sql)
```
