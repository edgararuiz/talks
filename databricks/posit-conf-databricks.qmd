## Spark Connect {background-image="assets/slide-frame.png"}

- Introduced a decoupled client-server architecture that allows remote
connectivity to Spark clusters using the DataFrame API. 

- The **separation will allow R users to interact with a cluster**
from the comfort of their preferred environment, laptop or otherwise.

- [Databricks
Connect](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html),
available in DBR version 13 and above, is based on this
new architecture.

## Integrating R  {background-image="assets/slide-frame.png"}

- Connect, uses of a remote procedure call framework, named gRPC.  **Torch**
for the ML capabilities.

- `PySpark`, the Python library, offers the best integration with Connect.

- `sparklyr` will integrate to PySpark via the `reticulate` package.

- Extends the functionality, and user experience: `dplyr` back-end, `DBI` back-end,
RStudio's *Connections pane* integration.
